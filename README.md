# permaCCize
This is a Google Apps Script that can be used to add [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) links to a Google Doc, either by:
- replacing all links in a document with Perma.cc links
- replacing all links in a selection with Perma.cc links
- appending bracketed Perma.cc links to footnotes

You'll need a Perma.cc API key.

Installation and use instructions to come.
